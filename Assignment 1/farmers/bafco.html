            <p>Thabo Mokhethi’s journey into farming started unexpectedly. After losing his job in Maseru, he returned to his rural home in Butha-Buthe and decided to plant a small plot of potatoes and beans.
Using drip irrigation systems he learned about online, Thabo transformed his modest 1-hectare plot into a highly productive farm that now supplies fresh produce to roadside vendors, hotels, and supermarkets in the region.</p><br>

    <p>Thabo is known for experimenting with soil enrichment techniques, like composting and crop rotation, which not only increase yields but also improve the land’s long-term fertility.
His vision is to make farming attractive to youth, showing them that with the right skills and mindset, agriculture can be both profitable and sustainable.</p><br>

    <p>Today, Thabo mentors young farmers and dreams of expanding his farm to include a greenhouse for year-round production.</p>
