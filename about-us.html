        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Welcome to <strong>Lesotho Hub</strong>, a digital space created to connect farmers with their communities and beyond. We believe in the power of agriculture to feed families, grow economies, and preserve cultural traditions. Our mission is simple: to give farmers a platform where their hard work can be seen, valued, and supported.</p>

        <h3>Who We Are</h3>
        <img src="../images/about/lettuce-seedlings-planted.jpg" alt="Seedlings" class="about-img">
        <p>Lesotho Hub is a farmer-focused initiative that highlights the rich agricultural potential of our nation. From the fertile lowlands to the rugged highlands, Lesotho is home to resilient farmers who grow crops, raise livestock, and sustain families through their dedication to the land.</p>
        <p>We exist to make these farmers visible. By showcasing their products, sharing their stories, and making their businesses accessible online, we help bridge the gap between farmers and customers in a modern, digital marketplace.</p>

        <ul class="about-list">

        <h3>Why Lesotho Hub Matters</h3>
        <img src="../images/about/plant.jpg" alt="Plant" class="about-img">
        <p>Agriculture is the backbone of our country, yet many farmers struggle to reach wider markets. Lesotho Hub changes that by offering farmers a voice and a platform to thrive in the digital age. We don’t just list products — we tell the stories behind them, reminding people that every bag of maize, every liter of milk, and every wool blanket represents hard work, heritage, and hope.</p>

    <div class="about-section">
        <h3>Our Vision</h3>
        <img src="../images/about/tractor.jpg" alt="Tractor" class="about-img">
        <p>To become the leading digital marketplace for farmers in Lesotho — one that empowers rural communities, strengthens the economy, and celebrates the dignity of farming.</p>
